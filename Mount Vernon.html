<p><DD>Mount Vernon was the estate of the first president of the United States, George Washington. Washington never lived in the White House, but he did spend extensive amounts of time at Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon is the second most visited presidential estate in the United States after Monticello. Today, Mount Vernon is steeped in American history and colonial architecture. Its importance to American history and deep connection to George Washington make it a popular tourist attraction and one of the most famous houses in the world.</DD></p>

<h2><DD> History  </DD></h2>

<p><DD>Mount Vernon is the former plantation estate and burial location of George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and the first President of the United States, his wife Martha and 20 other Washington family members. The current estate—which is open to visitors—includes a mansion, gardens, tombs, a working farm, a functioning distillery and gristmill, plus a museum and education center.</p></DD>

<p><DD> Mount Vernon was originally called Little Hunting Creek Plantation and was owned by John Washington. John eventually passed the estate to his son Lawrence who then passed it to his daughter Mildred.

In 1726, Mildred’s brother Augustine, George Washington’s father, purchased the estate and built the main part of the plantation house—an ordinary, one-and-a-half-story structure. Augustine passed the estate to his eldest son Lawrence, George’s elder half-brother, in 1740. Lawrence renamed it Mount Vernon after the famed English naval officer Admiral Edward Vernon.

George Washington inherited Mount Vernon only after the deaths of his brother Lawrence and Lawrence’s two heirs. Lawrence died in 1752, followed by his daughter, Sarah, in 1754 and Lawrence’s widow, Ann, in 1761.</p></DD>
