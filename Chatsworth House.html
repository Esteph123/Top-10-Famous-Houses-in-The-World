<p><DD>Even if you don’t recognize the name, you will likely recognize the appearance of Chatsworth House. Chatsworth House is an old house in the United Kingdom that has been the site of numerous period dramas, including popular movies and TV shows such as Peaky Blinders, Pride and Prejudice, and The Duchess. This house is the very image of Victorian Britain and has become an eponymous image of that time period. You can visit the iconic house and take a tour with the purchase of ticketed admission.</DD></p>

<h2><DD> History  </DD></h2>

<p><DD> The first house to be built on the Chatsworth House site was constructed in 1549 by Bess of Hardwick and her husband Sir William Cavendish. This original estate was notable for its use as a prison for Mary Queen of Scots, who was kept here on several occasions between 1569 and 1584. Little remains of the original structure except the Hunting Tower which still stands on the hill behind Chatsworth House.</p></DD>

<p><DD>It was not until 1686 that the 1st Duke of Devonshire began a major re-building programme at the house, constructing most of what survives today. While the 2nd and 3rd Dukes largely left the architecture of the house alone, they amassed its huge collection of notable artwork, from Ancient Greek and Roman sculpture to Old Master drawings. </p></DD>

<p><DD>The famous socialite Lady Georgiana Spencer and the 5th Duke of Devonshire lived here in the 18th century, while in the 19th the eccentric 6th Duke of Devonshire, or ‘the Bachelor Duke’, occupied its halls. Queen Victoria came to stay many times during his residency.
