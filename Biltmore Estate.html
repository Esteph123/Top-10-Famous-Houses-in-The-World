<p><DD>Biltmore Estate was the expansive home of the Vanderbilt family. The Vanderbilts were some of the wealthiest people in American history. Biltmore is the largest home in the United States and has been said to be the largest house in the world at times. Biltmore Estate includes 175,000 square feet of living space and 250 rooms, including 35 bedrooms and 43 bathrooms. The home included an indoor pool and basement bowling alley, which was the height of modern technology at the time. Today, curious people can visit the expansive manor and large gardens taking in the grandeur of the place for a modest cost.</DD></p>
