<p><DD>William Randolph Hearst was a publishing magnate and one of the world’s wealthiest and most eccentric people. Hearst decided to build himself a castle in California, befitting his hobbies and his money. Hearst built the castle in a Spanish style, and its iconic towers are still visible today in San Simeon. Like the old European castles and palaces that inspired him, Hearst filled his castle with expensive treasures and artifacts that he collected throughout his life. Hearst also threw elaborate parties in his castle in the 1920s that attracted the richest and most famous people of the era. Hearst Castle remains an oddity and an architectural wonder and you can visit and tour the house to this day.</DD></p>

<h2><DD> History  </DD></h2>

<p><DD>Hearst Castle’s history begins in 1865, when George Hearst purchased 40,000 acres of ranchland. After his mother’s death in 1919, William Randolph Hearst inherited thousands of acres around San Simeon, and over time, he purchased more. The spread eventually encompassed about 250,000 acres. With architect Julia Morgan, Hearst conceived a retreat he called La Cuesta Encantada—Spanish for “Enchanted Hill.” By 1947, when Hearst had to leave the remote location because of his fragile health, the estate was still unfinished even though it comprised 165 rooms and 123 acres of gardens, terraces, pools and walkways—all built to Hearst’s specifications and showcasing a legendary art collection.</p></DD>
