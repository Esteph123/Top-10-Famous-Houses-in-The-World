<p><DD>Windsor Castle is an ancient dwelling associated with the English royal family. The castle was built around 1100, making it nearly a thousand years old. It is the longest continually inhabited royal residence in Europe. The castle was a headquarters during the English Civil War. It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II. The late Queen Elizabeth II lived in the palace full time from 2011 until her death in 2022. When it comes to primary residences, there are few as grand or as old as Windsor Castle.</DD></p>

<h2><DD> History  </DD></h2>
<p><DD>Under King George IV, the Royal Collection Trust explains, "the gothic transformation" of Windsor Castle continued: "George IV and his artistic adviser Sir Charles Long wanted the exterior of the Castle to have a more imposing appearance".</p></DD>

<p><DD>His restoration of Windsor Castle was "so comprehensive" that his successors did little to change anything of the building. Indeed, he is the monarch "most closely associated with the appearance" of Windsor Castle today, per the Royal Collection Trust.</p></DD>
